Tools for Omega Space Green's Functions
==============================================

:func:`gf_trace.py`: Calculate the Density of States (DOS) value from an :math:`\omega`-dependent Green's Function. 
                     It makes the trace of the Green's Function associated with a certain frequency value. 

                     :attr:`Example :`

                     >>> python gf_trace.py /PATH/green.txt omega_value
                 
                     :attr:`green.txt`: formatted text file containing the Green's function.
                     :attr:`omega_value`: double frequency value.
