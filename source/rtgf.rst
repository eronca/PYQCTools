Tools for Real-Time Green's Functions
==============================================

:attr:`rtgf.py`: Calculate the Density of States (DOS) values during a time propagation.
                 It makes the trace of time-dependent Green's Functions calculated 
                 along a time propagation and return the DOS values as a function of time both for the real and for the imaginary part of the Green's Function.  

                     **Example :**

                     >>> python rtgf.py prop_time time_step /PATH/scratch

                     :attr:`prop_time`: double value of the full propagation time (period).

                     :attr:`time_step`: double value of the time-step.

                     :attr:`scratch`: directory containing text files of the real (green.$t.$t.txt) and imaginary (green.30000+$t.30000+$t.txt) Green's Functions, where $t indicate the specific time-step. 

                 The script save two output files, :attr:`rt_real.txt` and :attr:`rt_imag.txt`, containing the real and imaginary part of the time-dependent DOS respectively. 

:attr:`fft.py`:  Perform the fourier transform of the time-dependent Density of States (DOS).
                 It reads the :attr:`rt_real.txt` and :attr:`rt_imag.txt` generated by the :attr:`rtgf.py` script and produces the :attr:`ldos.out` and :attr:`real_part.txt` files containing the imaginary and real parts of the `\omega`-dependent DOS respectively.

                     **Example :**

                     >>> python fft.py broad rem_add

                     :attr:`broad`: double value of the imaginary broadening.

                     :attr:`rem_add`: string specifying if we are working with the addition or removal part of the Green's Function. It can assume only the values 'add' or 'rem'.
